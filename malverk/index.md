# Malverk

Malverk is by far what I am most well known for in the Balatro modding scene. It's a texture pack manager that makes development much cleaner than base Steamodded. I use it for most of my projects (SealSeal is the only exception, although that's only because it can run both with or without Malverk- more about that will come in a future tutorial.)

::: warning NOTE THIS
I am not a maintainer of Malverk and I have no say in its development. If you have questions or issues, please refer to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk). These docs are completely unofficial.

I love Malverk, but unfortunately the documentation is lackluster for it. That's why I made this site in the first place- because I think a more thorough wiki should be made.

::: info
If you are just getting started with Malverk, check out [my tutorial](./tutorial/basics)! I think it's better than trying to figure it out from only what's on the github page, although I'm biased :3
