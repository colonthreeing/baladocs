# Balatro Mod Managers

There are a few mod managers out there. The main one is [BMM](https://github.com/skyline69/balatro-mod-manager), although they hate linux support (this is mostly an overstatement, but they did never let my pull request go through for better support). If you are on Linux, go ahead and try out either [Bromomethene](https://github.com/skyline69/balatro-mod-manager), effectively a "fixed" version of BMM for linux, or my own homemade mod manager, [balatro-tui](https://github.com/colonthreeing/balatro-tui)

::: details On balatro-tui
So about balatro-tui. It's unfinished. I have made everything that I really need it for- it is blazingly fast (like damn, I wasn't expecting it to be that fast), and lets you install mods, but it doesn't have a few key features that I'll get to someday probably maybe (removing mods, disabling mods, et cetera). It is also only available on Linux. I have not extensively tested it either- it works fine for me, but no guarantees. Also, there's no flatpak or appimage or docker container, you'll have to download it from GitHub or build it manually from source (it uses Rust, so not too difficult). I can't personally recommend it for others to use, but hey yknow if you want to you can try it out.
