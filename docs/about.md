# About this site

Hey all! I'm colonthreeing (she/any). I am a hobbyist in the Balatro mod community- you can find the mods I have made [here](https://julies-stuff.dev/balatro). This website was mostly just made for me to record all my knowledge about modding as I do things. I figured *someone* will find it useful, at least for the [Malverk](/malverk/) part.

This site was made using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/), a static site generator for documentation. They don't require me to mention this, I just think it's a nice resource (and it's free!)
