# Steamodded (SMODS) Resources

Here's a list of good resources I have found for Steamodded. If you are looking for how to get started with modding, check out the [Basics of modding](</basics of modding>) page.

## The Most Useful
- [Steamodded Wiki](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki) - The official Steamodded wiki. Generally very useful, although it doesn't cover everything-- that's why this website is here :3
- [VanillaRemade](https://github.com/nh6574/VanillaRemade) - Every card that exists in Balatro, remade with Steamodded. By *far* the best resource for learning how jokers work.
    - On a similar note, VanillaRemade also has a very detailed [wiki](https://github.com/nh6574/VanillaRemade/wiki) which, while I haven't used it yet (only found out about it while writing this, actually), I almost certainly will in the future.
- [Steamodded Discord](https://discord.gg/W74mUS9wFn) - The official Steamodded Discord server, very nice and welcoming community. You can ask for any help you need here.
    - The official Balatro server also has a modding channel. It's really personal preference, but I think the Steamodded server is more welcoming.

## Getting More Specific
This is a list of more specific resources that may be useful for certain things. Namely, they are mods that I personally look at code from when I want something done that isn't covered easily by VanillaRemade.

- [BU Community Challenges](https://github.com/OceanRamen/BU-CB-DEV/tree/dev-main) - This is an excellent resource for custom challenge decks. I haven't found great information on making challenge decks myself (hey, maybe I'll make a page on that at some point), but for the time being, this is a great resource for examples of how to make challenges.

## The Cryptid situation is crazy
I love cryptid!! It's extremely well made, and a testament to just how extensive Balatro modding can be. But their mod is much more complicated than most, so pulling code from it is more difficult. Go ahead and look at it- it's all available for you to see [here](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Cryptid)- but it runs a lot of very custom code that you will also have to pull in or write yourself. I would not recommend it for any beginner modders.
